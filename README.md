Repository for the course 02223: Model Based Systems Engineering

Simulation of co2 generation inside a 3d city environment and implementation of a sensor system that effectively (accuracy + low cost) measures the the co2 levels.

How to run:
1. Clone the repository
2. On a terminal, change to the project directory and type: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. To run the simulation: `python main.py`

4. * Press `START the Simulation`, if you want to execute the simulation with the default values.
   * Press `Set Parameters`, in order to modify the parameters of the simulation.
     * Remember to always click on the corresponding button of a parameter, after you set its desired value.
     * When you are done, just press `THE PARAMETERS ARE SET !!` and then you are ready to start the simulation with the desired parameters.
   * Press `QUIT` if you want to exit the simulation and close all the windows.
