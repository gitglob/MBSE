How to run the simulation:

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/gitglob/MBSE/tree/Kostas_gui

2. On a terminal, change to the project directory and type: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. To run the simulation: `python main.py`
 
4. * Press `START the Simulation`, if you want to execute the simulation with the default values (`gui/gui.py -> lines: 5-12`).
   * Press `Set Parameters`, in order to modify the parameters of the simulation.
     * Remember to always click on the corresponding button of a parameter, after you set its desired value.
     * When you are done, just press `THE PARAMETERS ARE SET !!` and then you are ready to start the simulation with the desired parameters.
   * Press `Run Multiple Simulations`, in order to run our experiment plan. You can always modify the experiment plan in `main.py -> lines 28-30`
     * In the new window that appears you can set the days of the simulation.
     * Remember to always click on the corresponding button of a parameter, after you set its desired value.
     * When you are done, just press `THE PARAMETERS ARE SET !!` and then you are ready to start the simulation with the desired parameters.
   * Press `QUIT` if you want to exit the simulation and close all the windows.
